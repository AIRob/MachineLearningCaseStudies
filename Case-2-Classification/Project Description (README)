Description:

The project is finished by three Machine Tools as planned. I will upload the scripts in three tools seperately and compare the performance of them.

1. IPython Notebook (GraphLab)

Script, Report: Analyzing product sentiment By GraphLab.ipynb

Models Tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees

2: IPython Notebook (Scikit-Learn)

Script, Report: Amazon Sentiment Classification By Sklearn.ipynb

Model Tried:Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees

Priority: Natural Language Process in Python (Graphlab has advanced function that does not need to do it step-by-step)
