Description:

The project is finished by two Machine Tools as planned. I will upload the scripts in three tools seperately and compare the performance of them.

1. IPython Notebook (GraphLab)

Script, Report: Song Recommender by Graphlab.ipynb

Method: using Graphlab built-in recommendation methods to realize the function of recommendation.

2: IPython Notebook (Scikit-Learn)

Script, Report: Song Recommendation by Sklearn.ipynb

Method: Break down the details of recommendation system by using sklearn and pandas. In this case, the method is:User-Item Collaborative Filtering.

Notion: Due to the memory of my laptop, I just use first 100,000 rows of data. This demonstrates how computationally powerful the graphlab is.
