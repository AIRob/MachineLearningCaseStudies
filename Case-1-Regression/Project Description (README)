## Description:

The project is finished by three Machine Tools as planned. I will upload the scripts in three tools seperately and compare the performance of them.

1: RStudio:

Script: Predicting House Prices.Rmd

Report: Predicting House Prices.pdf

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest

2: IPython Notebook (GraphLab)

Script:Regression Predicting House Prices with GraphLab.ipynb

Report: Regression Predicting House Prices with GraphLab.md

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Boosting Model

3: Ipython Notebook (Scikit-Learn)

Script: Regression Predicting House Prices with Scikit-learn.ipynb

Report: Regression Predicting House Prices with Scikit-learn.md

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest (Two models), Lasso, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting (Two Models)
