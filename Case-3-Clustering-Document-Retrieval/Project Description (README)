Description:

The project is finished by two Machine Tools as planned. I will upload the scripts in three tools seperately and compare the performance of them.

1. IPython Notebook (GraphLab)

Script, Report: Document retrieval graphlab.ipynb

Method: using Knn to find nearset neighbours.

2: IPython Notebook (Scikit-Learn)

Script, Report: Document Retrieval Sklearn.ipynb

Focus: Natural Language Processing.
