# Machine Learning Case Studies
Following the course of Machine Learning Foundation--- Case Study Approach by Washington University, I replicate all the cases used in the course by R, which is more widely used than IPython and GraphLab.  Course Link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/home/welcome 

# Case 1: Regression

## Description from the course 

In this module, we focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...). We also built an iPython notebook for predicting house prices, using data from King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located.

In this assignment, we are going to build a more accurate regression model for predicting house prices by including more features of the house. In the process, we will also become more familiar with how the Python language can be used for data exploration, data transformations and machine learning. These techniques will be key to building intelligent applications.
