Description:

The project is finished by two Machine Tools as planned. I will upload the scripts in three tools seperately and compare the performance of them.

1. IPython Notebook (GraphLab)

Script, Report: Image Classification with Deep Features By Graphlab.ipynb (For classification)
                Deep features for image retrieval By Graphlab.ipynb (For image retrieval)
               
Priority: Demonstrate the effectiveness of deep features and show how to implement the whole process in Graphlab
